# Android In-App Billing v3 Library [![Build Status](https://github.com/anjlab/android-inapp-billing-v3/actions/workflows/connected-check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/anjlab/android-inapp-billing-v3/actions/workflows/connected-check.yml)  [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.anjlab.android.iab.v3/library/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.anjlab.android.iab.v3/library)
This is a simple, straight-forward implementation of the Android v4 In-app billing API.

It supports: In-App Product Purchases (both non-consumable and consumable) and Subscriptions.

**Keep in mind**, the library will provide the client side features necessary to implement in-app purchases but will still require quite a lot of work on your side. You'll also have to implement the server to validate your receipts (which is probably the most time consuming part to do correctly).

If you're looking for a *Plug & Play* SDK that does everything (including the server validation of your receipts), you can use the [IAPHUB SDK](https://github.com/iaphub/iaphub-android-sdk).

## Maintainers Wanted

This project is looking for maintainers. 

For now only pull requests of external contributors are being reviewed, accepted and welcomed. No more bug fixes or new features will be implemented by the Anjlab team. 

If you are interesting in giving this project some :heart:, please chime in!

## v4 API Upgrade Notice

Originally this was Google's v2 Billing API implementation, for those who  interested all source code kept safe [here](https://github.com/anjlab/android-inapp-billing-v3/tree/v2_billing_1_1_0).

If you got your app using this library previously, here is the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/anjlab/android-inapp-billing-v3/blob/master/UPGRADING.md).

## Getting Started

* You project should build against Android 4.0 SDK at least.

* Add this *Android In-App Billing v3 Library* to your project:
  - If you guys are using Eclipse, download latest jar version from the [releases](https://github.com/anjlab/android-inapp-billing-v3/releases) section of this repository and add it as a dependency
  - If you guys are using Android Studio and Gradle, add this to you build.gradle file:
```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.anjlab.android.iab.v3:library:2.0.3'
}
```

* Create instance of BillingProcessor class and implement callback in your Activity source code. Constructor will take 3 parameters:
  - **Context**
  - **Your License Key from Google Developer console.** This will be used to verify purchase signatures. You can pass NULL if you would like to skip this check (*You can find your key in Google Play Console -> Your App Name -> Services & APIs*)
  - **IBillingHandler Interface implementation to handle purchase results and errors** (see below)
```java
public class SomeActivity extends Activity implements BillingProcessor.IBillingHandler {
  BillingProcessor bp;

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    bp = new BillingProcessor(this, "YOUR LICENSE KEY FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", this);
    bp.initialize();
    // or bp = BillingProcessor.newBillingProcessor(this, "YOUR LICENSE KEY FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", this);
    // See below on why this is a useful alternative
  }
	
  // IBillingHandler implementation
	
  @Override
  public void onBillingInitialized() {
    /*
    * Called when BillingProcessor was initialized and it's ready to purchase 
    */
  }
	
  @Override
  public void onProductPurchased(String productId, PurchaseInfo purchaseInfo) {
    /*
    * Called when requested PRODUCT ID was successfully purchased
    */
  }
	
  @Override
  public void onBillingError(int errorCode, Throwable error) {
    /*
    * Called when some error occurred. See Constants class for more details
    * 
    * Note - this includes handling the case where the user canceled the buy dialog:
    * errorCode = Constants.BILLING_RESPONSE_RESULT_USER_CANCELED
    */
  }
	
  @Override
  public void onPurchaseHistoryRestored() {
    /*
    * Called when purchase history was restored and the list of all owned PRODUCT ID's 
    * was loaded from Google Play
    */
  }
}
```

* Call `purchase` method for a BillingProcessor instance to initiate purchase or `subscribe` to initiate a subscription:

```java
bp.purchase(YOUR_ACTIVITY, "YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
bp.subscribe(YOUR_ACTIVITY, "YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
```


* **That's it! A super small and fast in-app library ever!**

* **And don't forget**
 to release your BillingProcessor instance! 
```java
@Override
public void onDestroy() {
  if (bp != null) {
    bp.release();
  }		
  super.onDestroy();
}
```

### Instantiating a `BillingProcessor` with late initialization
The basic `new BillingProcessor(...)` actually binds to Play Services inside the constructor. This can, very rarely, lead to a race condition where Play Services are bound and `onBillingInitialized()` is called before the constructor finishes, and can lead to NPEs. To avoid this, we have the following:
```java
bp = BillingProcessor.newBillingProcessor(this, "YOUR LICENSE KEY FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", this); // doesn't bind
bp.initialize(); // binds
```

## Testing In-app Billing

Here is a [complete guide](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing.html).
Make sure you read it before you start testing

## Check Play Market services availability

Before any usage it's good practice to check in-app billing services availability.
In some older devices or chinese ones it may happen that Play Market is unavailable or is deprecated
 and doesn't support in-app billing.

Simply call static method `BillingProcessor.isIabServiceAvailable(context)`:
```java
boolean isAvailable = BillingProcessor.isIabServiceAvailable(this);
if(!isAvailable) {
  // continue
}
```
Please notice that calling `BillingProcessor.isIabServiceAvailable()` (only checks Play Market app installed or not) is not enough because there might be a case when it returns true but still payment won't succeed.
Therefore, it's better to call `bp.isConnected()` after initializing `BillingProcessor`:
```java
boolean isConnected = billingProcessor.isConnected();
if(isConnected) {
  // launch payment flow
}
```
or call `isSubscriptionUpdateSupported()` for checking update subscription use case:
```java
boolean isSubsUpdateSupported = billingProcessor.isSubscriptionUpdateSupported();
if(isSubsUpdateSupported) {
  // launch payment flow
}
```

## Consume Purchased Products

You can always consume made purchase and allow to buy same product multiple times. To do this you need:
```java
bp.consumePurchaseAsync("YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", new IPurchasesResponseListener());
```

## Restore Purchases & Subscriptions

```java
bp.loadOwnedPurchasesFromGoogleAsync(new IPurchasesResponseListener());
```

## Getting Listing Details of Your Products

To query listing price and a description of your product / subscription listed in Google Play use these methods:

```java
bp.getPurchaseListingDetailsAsync("YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", new ISkuDetailsResponseListener());
bp.getSubscriptionListingDetailsAsync("YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", new ISkuDetailsResponseListener());
```

As a result you will get a callback call including `List<SkuDetails>` data with one SkuDetails object with the following info included:

```java
public final String productId;
public final String title;
public final String description;
public final boolean isSubscription;
public final String currency;
public final Double priceValue;
public final String priceText;
```

To get info for multiple products / subscriptions on one query, just pass a list of product ids:

```java
bp.getPurchaseListingDetailsAsync(arrayListOfProductIds, new ISkuDetailsResponseListener());
bp.getSubscriptionListingDetailsAsync(arrayListOfProductIds, new ISkuDetailsResponseListener());
```

where arrayListOfProductIds is a `ArrayList<String>` containing either IDs for products or subscriptions.


## Getting Purchase Info Details
`PurchaseInfo` object is passed to `onProductPurchased` method of a handler class.
However, you can always retrieve it later calling these methods:

```java
bp.getPurchaseInfo("YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
bp.getSubscriptionPurchaseInfo("YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
```

As a result you will get a `PurchaseInfo` object with the following info included:

```java
public final String responseData;
public final String signature;

// PurchaseData contains orderId, productId, purchaseTime, purchaseToken, purchaseState and autoRenewing fields 
public final PurchaseData purchaseData;
```

## Handle Canceled Subscriptions

Call `bp.getSubscriptionPurchaseInfo(...)` and check the `purchaseData.autoRenewing` flag.
It will be set to `False` once subscription gets cancelled.
Also notice, that you will need to call periodically `bp.loadOwnedPurchasesFromGoogleAsync()` method in order to update subscription information

## Promo Codes Support

You can use promo codes along with this library. Promo codes can be entered in the purchase dialog or in the Google Play app. The URL https://play.google.com/redeem?code=YOUR_PROMO_CODE will launch the Google Play app with the promo code already entered. This could come in handy if you want to give users the option to enter a promo code within your app.

## Protection Against Fake "Markets"

There are number of attacks which exploits some vulnerabilities of Google's Play Market.
Among them is so-called *Freedom attack*: *Freedom* is special Android application, which
intercepts application calls to Play Market services and substitutes them with fake ones. So in the
  end attacked application *thinks* that it receives valid responses from Play Market.

In order to protect from this kind of attack you should specify your `merchantId`, which
can be found in your [Payments Merchant Account](https://payments.google.com/merchant).
Selecting *Settings->Public Profile* you will find your unique `merchantId`

**WARNING:** keep your `merchantId` in safe place!

Then using `merchantId` just call constructor:

    public BillingProcessor(Context context, String licenseKey, String merchantId, IBillingHandler handler);

Later one can easily check transaction validity using method:

    public boolean isValidPurchaseInfo(PurchaseInfo purchaseInfo);

P.S. This kind of protection works only for transactions dated between 5th December 2012 and
21st July 2015. Before December 2012 `orderId` wasn't contain `merchantId` and in the end of July this
 year Google suddenly changed `orderId` format.
 
## Proguard

The necessary proguard rules are already added in the library. No further configurations are needed.

The contents in the consumer proguard file contains:

```
-keep class com.android.vending.billing.**
```
