Android In-App Billing v3 Library
=======================

This is a simple, straight-forward implementation of the Android v3 In-app billing API.

It supports: In-App Product Purchases (both non-consumable and consumable) and Subscriptions.

Getting Started
===============

* You project should build against Android 2.2 SDK at least.

* Add this *Android In-App Billing v3 Library* to your project:
  - If you guys are using Eclipse, download latest jar version from the [releases](https://github.com/anjlab/android-inapp-billing-v3/releases) section of this repository and add it as a dependency
  - If you guys are using Android Studio and Gradle, add this to you build.gradle file:
```groovy
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
       compile 'com.anjlab.android.iab.v3:library:1.0.+@aar'
    }
```

* Open the *AndroidManifest.xml* of your application and add this permission:
```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
```
* Create instance of BillingProcessor class and implement callback in your Activity source code. Constructor will take 3 parameters:
  - **Context**
  - **Your License Key from Google Developer console.** This will be used to verify purchase signatures. You can pass NULL if you would like to skip this check (*You can find your key in Google Play Console -> Your App Name -> Services & APIs*)
  - **IBillingHandler Interface implementation to handle purchase results and errors** (see below)
```java
public class SomeActivity extends Activity implements BillingProcessor.IBillingHandler {
	BillingProcessor bp;

	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

		bp = new BillingProcessor(this, "YOUR LICENSE KEY FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", this);
	}
	
	// IBillingHandler implementation
	
	@Override
	public void onBillingInitialized() {
		/*
		 * Called then BillingProcessor was initialized and its ready to purchase 
		 */
	}
	
	@Override
	public void onProductPurchased(String productId, TransactionDetails details) {
		/*
		 * Called then requested PRODUCT ID was successfully purchased
		 */
	}
	
	@Override
	public void onBillingError(int errorCode, Throwable error) {
		/*
		 * Called then some error occured. See Constants class for more details
		 */
	}
	
	@Override
	public void onPurchaseHistoryRestored() {
		/*
		 * Called then purchase history was restored and the list of all owned PRODUCT ID's 
		 * was loaded from Google Play
		 */
	}
}
```

* override Activity's onActivityResult method:
```java
  @Override
	protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
		if (!bp.handleActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data))
			super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
	}
```

* Call `purchase` method for a BillingProcessor instance to initiate purchase or `subscribe` to initiate a subscription:
```java
bp.purchase(YOUR_ACTIVITY, "YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
bp.subscribe(YOUR_ACTIVITY, "YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
```
* **That's it! A super small and fast in-app library ever!**

* **And dont forget**
 to release your BillingProcessor instance! 
```java
	@Override
	public void onDestroy() {
		if (bp != null) 
			bp.release();
		
		super.onDestroy();
	}
```

Consume Purchased Products
--------------------------
You can always consume made purchase and allow to buy same product multiple times. To do this you need:
```java
	bp.consumePurchase("YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
```

Restore Purchases & Subscriptions
--------------------------
```java
	bp.loadOwnedPurchasesFromGoogle();
```

Notice On Canceled/Expired Subscriptions
--------------------------
Since Google's v3 API doesn't provide any callbacks to handle canceled and/or expired subscriptions you have to handle it on your own.
The easiest way to do this - call periodically `bp.loadOwnedPurchasesFromGoogle()` method.

Getting Listing Details of Your Products
--------------------------
To query listing price and a description of your product / subscription listed in Google Play use these methods:

```java
    bp.getPurchaseListingDetails("YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
    bp.getSubscriptionListingDetails("YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
```

As a result you will get a `SkuDetails` object with the following info included:

```java
    public final String productId;
    public final String title;
    public final String description;
    public final boolean isSubscription;
    public final String currency;
    public final Double priceValue;
    public final String priceText;
```

Getting Purchase Transaction Details
--------------------------
As a part or 1.0.9 changes, `TransactionDetails` object is passed to `onProductPurchased` method of a handler class.
However, you can always retrieve it later calling these methods:

```java
    bp.getPurchaseTransactionDetails("YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
    bp.getSubscriptionTransactionDetails("YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
```

As a result you will get a `TransactionDetails` object with the following info included:

```java
    public final String productId;
    public final String orderId;
    public final String purchaseToken;
    public final Date purchaseTime;
    
    // containing the raw json string from google play and the signature to
    // verify the purchase on your own server
    public final PurchaseInfo purchaseInfo;
```
