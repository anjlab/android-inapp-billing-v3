# Android In-App Billing v3 Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anjlab/android-inapp-billing-v3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anjlab/android-inapp-billing-v3)  [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.anjlab.android.iab.v3/library/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.anjlab.android.iab.v3/library)

This is a simple, straight-forward implementation of the Android v3 In-app billing API.

It supports: In-App Product Purchases (both non-consumable and consumable) and Subscriptions.

## Getting Started

* You project should build against Android 2.2 SDK at least.

* Add this *Android In-App Billing v3 Library* to your project:
  - If you guys are using Eclipse, download latest jar version from the [releases](https://github.com/anjlab/android-inapp-billing-v3/releases) section of this repository and add it as a dependency
  - If you guys are using Android Studio and Gradle, add this to you build.gradle file:
```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
  compile 'com.anjlab.android.iab.v3:library:1.0.44'
}
```

* Open the *AndroidManifest.xml* of your application and add this permission:
```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
```
* Create instance of BillingProcessor class and implement callback in your Activity source code. Constructor will take 3 parameters:
  - **Context**
  - **Your License Key from Google Developer console.** This will be used to verify purchase signatures. You can pass NULL if you would like to skip this check (*You can find your key in Google Play Console -> Your App Name -> Services & APIs*)
  - **IBillingHandler Interface implementation to handle purchase results and errors** (see below)
```java
public class SomeActivity extends Activity implements BillingProcessor.IBillingHandler {
  BillingProcessor bp;

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    bp = new BillingProcessor(this, "YOUR LICENSE KEY FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", this);
    // or bp = BillingProcessor.newBillingProcessor(this, "YOUR LICENSE KEY FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", this);
    // See below on why this is a useful alternative
  }
	
  // IBillingHandler implementation
	
  @Override
  public void onBillingInitialized() {
    /*
    * Called when BillingProcessor was initialized and it's ready to purchase 
    */
  }
	
  @Override
  public void onProductPurchased(String productId, TransactionDetails details) {
    /*
    * Called when requested PRODUCT ID was successfully purchased
    */
  }
	
  @Override
  public void onBillingError(int errorCode, Throwable error) {
    /*
    * Called when some error occurred. See Constants class for more details
    * 
    * Note - this includes handling the case where the user canceled the buy dialog:
    * errorCode = Constants.BILLING_RESPONSE_RESULT_USER_CANCELED
    */
  }
	
  @Override
  public void onPurchaseHistoryRestored() {
    /*
    * Called when purchase history was restored and the list of all owned PRODUCT ID's 
    * was loaded from Google Play
    */
  }
}
```

* override Activity's onActivityResult method:
```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
  if (!bp.handleActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
  }  
}
```

* Call `purchase` method for a BillingProcessor instance to initiate purchase or `subscribe` to initiate a subscription:

_Without a developer payload:_
```java
bp.purchase(YOUR_ACTIVITY, "YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
bp.subscribe(YOUR_ACTIVITY, "YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
```
_With a developer payload:_
```java
bp.purchase(YOUR_ACTIVITY, "YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", "DEVELOPER PAYLOAD HERE");
bp.subscribe(YOUR_ACTIVITY, "YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", "DEVELOPER PAYLOAD HERE");
```
_IMPORTANT: when you provide a payload, internally the library prepends a string to your payload. For subscriptions, it prepends `"subs:\<productId\>:"`, and for products, it prepends `"inapp:\<productId\>:\<UUID\>:"`. This is important to know if you do any validation on the payload returned from Google Play after a successful purchase._

_With a bundle of extra parameters:_

```java
Bundle extraParams = new Bundle()
extraParams.putString("accountId", "MY_ACCOUNT_ID");
bp.purchase(YOUR_ACTIVITY, "YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", null /*or developer payload*/, extraParams);
bp.subscribe(YOUR_ACTIVITY, "YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", null /*or developer payload*/, extraParams);
```

Use these methods if you want to pass extra parameters, [as documented here](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_reference.html#getBuyIntentExtraParams), you can provide a Bundle object.

_Please note that this feature is only available if the target device is support the version 7 of the In App billing API._

* **That's it! A super small and fast in-app library ever!**

* **And don't forget**
 to release your BillingProcessor instance! 
```java
@Override
public void onDestroy() {
  if (bp != null) {
    bp.release();
  }		
  super.onDestroy();
}
```

### Instantiating a `BillingProcessor` with late initialization
The basic `new BillingProcessor(...)` actually binds to Play Services inside the constructor. This can, very rarely, lead to a race condition where Play Services are bound and `onBillingInitialized()` is called before the constructor finishes, and can lead to NPEs. To avoid this, we have the following:
```java
bp = BillingProcessor.newBillingProcessor(this, "YOUR LICENSE KEY FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE", this); // doesn't bind
bp.initialize(); // binds
```

## Testing In-app Billing

Here is a [complete guide](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing.html).
Make sure you read it before you start testing

## Check Play Market services availability

Before any usage it's good practice to check in-app billing services availability.
In some older devices or chinese ones it may happen that Play Market is unavailable or is deprecated
 and doesn't support in-app billing.

Simply call static method `BillingProcessor.isIabServiceAvailable()`:
```java
boolean isAvailable = BillingProcessor.isIabServiceAvailable();
if(!isAvailable) {
  // continue
}
```
Please notice that calling `BillingProcessor.isIabServiceAvailable()` (only checks Play Market app installed or not) is not enough because there might be a case when it returns true but still payment won't succeed.
Therefore, it's better to call `isOneTimePurchaseSupported()` after initializing `BillingProcessor`:
```java
boolean isOneTimePurchaseSupported = billingProcessor.isOneTimePurchaseSupported();
if(isOneTimePurchaseSupported) {
  // launch payment flow
}
```
or call `isSubscriptionUpdateSupported()` for checking update subscription use case:
```java
boolean isSubsUpdateSupported = billingProcessor.isSubscriptionUpdateSupported();
if(isSubsUpdateSupported) {
  // launch payment flow
}
```

## Consume Purchased Products

You can always consume made purchase and allow to buy same product multiple times. To do this you need:
```java
bp.consumePurchase("YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
```

## Restore Purchases & Subscriptions

```java
bp.loadOwnedPurchasesFromGoogle();
```

## Getting Listing Details of Your Products

To query listing price and a description of your product / subscription listed in Google Play use these methods:

```java
bp.getPurchaseListingDetails("YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
bp.getSubscriptionListingDetails("YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
```

As a result you will get a `SkuDetails` object with the following info included:

```java
public final String productId;
public final String title;
public final String description;
public final boolean isSubscription;
public final String currency;
public final Double priceValue;
public final String priceText;
```

To get info for multiple products / subscriptions on one query, just pass a list of product ids:

```java
bp.getPurchaseListingDetails(arrayListOfProductIds);
bp.getSubscriptionListingDetails(arrayListOfProductIds);
```

where arrayListOfProductIds is a `ArrayList<String>` containing either IDs for products or subscriptions.

As a result you will get a `List<SkuDetails>` which contains objects described above.

## Getting Purchase Transaction Details
As a part or 1.0.9 changes, `TransactionDetails` object is passed to `onProductPurchased` method of a handler class.
However, you can always retrieve it later calling these methods:

```java
bp.getPurchaseTransactionDetails("YOUR PRODUCT ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
bp.getSubscriptionTransactionDetails("YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID FROM GOOGLE PLAY CONSOLE HERE");
```

As a result you will get a `TransactionDetails` object with the following info included:

```java
public final String productId;
public final String orderId;
public final String purchaseToken;
public final Date purchaseTime;
    
// containing the raw json string from google play and the signature to
// verify the purchase on your own server
public final PurchaseInfo purchaseInfo;
```

## Handle Canceled Subscriptions

Call `bp.getSubscriptionTransactionDetails(...)` and check the `purchaseInfo.purchaseData.autoRenewing` flag.
It will be set to `False` once subscription gets cancelled.
Also notice, that you will need to call periodically `bp.loadOwnedPurchasesFromGoogle()` method in order to update subscription information

## Promo Codes Support

You can use promo codes along with this library.

## Protection Against Fake "Markets"

There are number of attacks which exploits some vulnerabilities of Google's Play Market.
Among them is so-called *Freedom attack*: *Freedom* is special Android application, which
intercepts application calls to Play Market services and substitutes them with fake ones. So in the
  end attacked application *thinks* that it receives valid responses from Play Market.

In order to protect from this kind of attack you should specify your `merchantId`, which
can be found in your [Payments Merchant Account](https://payments.google.com/merchant).
Selecting *Settings->Public Profile* you will find your unique `merchantId`

**WARNING:** keep your `merchantId` in safe place!

Then using `merchantId` just call constructor:

    public BillingProcessor(Context context, String licenseKey, String merchantId, IBillingHandler handler);

Later one can easily check transaction validity using method:

    public boolean isValid(TransactionDetails transactionDetails);

P.S. This kind of protection works only for transactions dated between 5th December 2012 and
21st July 2015. Before December 2012 `orderId` wasn't contain `merchantId` and in the end of July this
 year Google suddenly changed `orderId` format.
 
## Proguard

The necessary proguard rules are already added in the library. No further configurations are needed.

The contents in the consumer proguard file contains:

```
-keep class com.android.vending.billing.**
```
